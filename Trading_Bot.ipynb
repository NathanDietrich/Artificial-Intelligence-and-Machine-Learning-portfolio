Also, it's worth noting that recession starts at the PEAK of economic strength, so using things like current GDP estimate doesn't mean much. Q4 2007 GDP was estimated to be 2.5%.

They are at their previous peak level which means they are headed for a dip - perhaps a dip some may buy - but a dip none the less.\n",
            "So you agree they're not worth half a trillion, but rather at present, worth a quarter trillion, and they are much less attractive than the rest of the tech sector. That's my point. They don't have a story to run on to add another 10% to their market cap, which means they are destined to lose at least that much. The only real question is whether that will happen this week, this month, or this quarter. Your point is well taken, but think it proves mine.\n",
            "Today the market cap is $225B. If they are supposedly like Nvidia, they should be looking to double in value over the next year or two based on current projections and sentiment. If you can't tell a story that they will be exponentially increasing in value, how can their present day value be justified? In fact, it stands to reason that their present day value is bloated. They likely aren't actually worth more than $100B market cap, even though they stand as a fixture of their industry. That industry is going to change, they have no answer for it, and that's why I posed the hypothetical - also it helped make people look into it - so we'll see how things go.\n",
            "You might be right. But nothing about Cisco is protective enough that another OEM brand couldn't modify an existing spec to compete with them. They are considered the \"800 pound gorilla,\" but they are being outpaced in terms of stock market value. I guess that's the most succinct point here. Their company is potentially a requisite for networking, but that doesn't mean it is worth $250B, and their chart looks like an innovative tech company, when they are an old fart by comparison.\n",

If Cisco isn't paying attention to recent college grads and what benefits they want or how enticing the recruitment process is, they'll lose employees. Same goes for customers and resellers.

If you compare the expenses, reach, and revenue potential, choosing Netflix to distribute your film is unmatched. Right now, they don’t have any real competition. The film industry is driven by volume, and with more subscribers, Netflix can offer more money to secure top-tier films. This makes it increasingly difficult for new streaming services to compete.

They are partnered with Analog (Founder and CEO is Alex Kipman who invented the HoloLens). They’re backed by G42 who just invested $10 million.  And they’re about to release the benchmark results for their flagship product in the next month or so.  The next financing round is for $350 million at a $3.5 billion valuation and is contingent upon the benchmark results. VERSES Al’s white papers, particularly the one titled “From pixels to planning: scale-free active inference,” outline their approach to the MNIST benchmark using Renormalizing Generative Models (RGMs). This new Al foundation achieves 99.8% accuracy on a subset of the MNIST digit recognition task using 90% less data than conventional methods.  If they’re able to prove that they can achieve this level of accuracy with 90% less data as the next best current alternative then they’re poised to make waves. They’re aiming to get uplisted to the Nasdaq soon I speculate after this financing round. Also the CEO, Gabe Rene, just got the protocols for the spatial web (HSML and HSTP) approved by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.  This organization is responsible for standardizing WiFi, Ethernet, and Bluetooth.  Which is why all of those things are interoperable. The same needs to happen for AI so it isn’t siloed.

While early adoption may focus on premium, short-distance travel (like between airports and city centers), the long-term vision is urban air mobility that’s more affordable, eco-friendly, and efficient.

            "**2. Pilots for Now, Automation Later:** Most eVTOLs will be piloted like helicopters at first, but as tech and regulations evolve, we could see automated systems take over. Redundant safety features are already in place to keep things secure. 🛡️\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Air Traffic Management:** Companies are working closely with the FAA to roll out a controlled, step-by-step integration into urban airspace. It’s not going to be an overnight switch to thousands of eVTOLs, but a gradual ramp-up. 🌆🛫\n",
            "\n",
            "**4. Insurance Evolution:** You’re spot on—insurance will be tricky, but this is something we’ve seen before with early electric vehicles. Insurers are already getting involved, and as eVTOLs prove themselves, the insurance market will adjust. 💸\n",
            "\n",
            "These are big hurdles, no doubt, but if it all comes together, it’s going to be revolutionary. Plus, with **high short interest** and recent movement, we might not have to wait as long as people think to see some action. 🚀\n",

            "I get why it might seem off to call it \"fair,\" but I was acknowledging the risk and cash burn that comes with early-stage companies like ACHR. But you're right—there’s more to the story. ACHR isn’t just a speculative play; they’ve **actually delivered** on contracts, specifically with the **U.S. Air Force**, which is a big deal.\n",
            "\n",
            "This isn’t some pie-in-the-sky project—they’ve proven their tech works, and that gives them an edge when it comes to **FAA approval** and future expansion. Plus, their deals outside the U.S., like in the UAE, show they’re making strategic moves globally. It’s not a NIO situation where the product didn’t exist—ACHR is already demonstrating what it can do. 🚁✈️\n",
            "The problem is.. you fail to see this whole thing is doomed. You won't see flying commercial transport in urban territories in our lifetime. People are barely smart enough to operate normal cars, what's left for flying ones. You can surely make some money out of it, but it's a stupid idea to bet your money on in the long term.\n",
            "You talk like chatgpt if chatgpt was keen on monching on crayons and Elmer's school glue as a snack\n",
            "I totally get where you’re coming from—urban air mobility is a massive challenge, and there are a lot of hurdles to clear. But it’s not just about putting flying cars out there tomorrow. The focus right now is on gradual integration, like airport shuttles and intercity routes, where there’s more control over routes and airspace.\n",
            "\n",
            "As for piloting, most of these eVTOLs will be operated by trained pilots at first, not everyday drivers. It’s going to be a slow rollout, but the groundwork is being laid, especially with partnerships like ACHR’s contract with the U.S. Air Force. Whether it’s a long-term bet or not, there’s still some interesting short-term potential here given the setup and current interes\n",

However, OKLO’s design is a replica (EBR2) that had already been built and ran without issue for three decades. You can’t argue that an already proven design has more regulatory approval risk than a novel design, despite the similarities between AP300 and AP1000. When you combine this with a 5-year head-start on anticipated timelines, OKLO seems like a great bet and stands to benefit from a first-mover advantage.\n",

OKLO’s’ future is obviously speculative- I’m just laying out some of the reasons to believe and what could drive massive upside if they are able to execute. If they are able to 1- get regulatory approval remotely close to stated timeline, 2- build, deploy, and scale in a cost-effective manner, and 3- increase their order book across large partners and sectors then I think it could be a once in a lifetime investment opportunity.\n",

Initial combined licenses take 24 months are they are submitting next year, which takes us to 2027 for deployment. Any **other** deployment would use the first approval as a reference application (leveraging new framework) which takes as little as 7 months and mainly only focuses on site differences. You are an angry, bitter person- it’s coming through quite clearly. You are the cultist labelling misinformation when you literally don’t know anything. I have to do my actual job now, have a nice day.\n",
            "Yeah, well put. I do think that 2030-2040 will type time frame for mass-scaling, essentially everything before that is approval and getting everything ready for commercialization.

Then came the social media pushes, then successful lobbying at COP28.  People seemed most excited about reactors that \"recycle\" the waste.  They still produce waste, and once we run out of the waste that's been generated from traditional reactors they'll have to feed them with fresh material.  The reactor material its self also ultimately becomes radiated and starts to break down overtime, and that is part of the waste, not just the spent fuel.  When nuclear powered submarines and ships are decommissioned they have to just cut out the section of the ship with the reactor in it because they can't recycle all the irradiated material.\n",

The reason the US Dollar is a stable (dramatically more than bitcoin) and widely-adopted currency is, in part, that it is backed by the nation with the highest GDP in the world. Crypto is not stable, and is not widely adopted. It is also backed by nothing.  As far as limited supply goes -- the fact is that Bitcoin can easily be displaced by any number of similar (or better) crypto schemes. There is nothing special about Bitcoin other than the fact that it was the first attempt.  Unfortunately for Michael Saylor, if the USA or the EU or China, etc decide to go the route of crypt currencies, they will certainly mint a new one rather than adopting a currency that is 90% owned by the top 10% of 'investors'.\n",

The big the spooked me when I looked at them 18 months ago was that their moat was pretty weak in that every man and their dog was launching a streaming service. They don’t had infrastructure so they were vulnerable to players like google, apple, amazon and meta. They don’t own massive back catalogs historical of content I.e. fox, wb, Disney, paramount etc so I honestly thought it was going to turn into a race to the bottom what’s bizarre is that prices were increasing which doesn’t make sense in a market with stiff competition which if you ask me reeks of collusion and price fixing now that I think about it.

On the other hands, I’ve been burnt before for not taking gains like NVida it’s tripled on me and I know I should take gains but everyone on wsb is saying it’s tapped out but there aren’t any really good bets to move the money to your point if there isn’t a good option I’ll leave it where it is but should we really just be closing the position and sitting on the cash like Buffett would waiting for an opportunity to come up\n",
