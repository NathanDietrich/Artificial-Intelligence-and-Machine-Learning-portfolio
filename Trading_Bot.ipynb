Eventually, most of the computers in the state could not be on the network because they didn't meet the hardware requirements to hold security software. Over a year I was asking for computers, until I finally initiated a contract myself. My HQ wanted me to expand the contract to get laptops for the brigade (it's the same amount of work, so I just increased the quantity/value of what I was requesting). $1200 a laptop, with software. Not terrible considering. However, once I sent the contract off, my S4 increased the specs of the laptops, and the contract ballooned to $4300 a laptop.    \n",
