This past Saturday I had it get spooked by a puddle and attempt to veer into the lane on my left, which would have been right into an SUV. It did hesitate after beginning the maneuver though, and had I not taken control I think it may have ultimately made the right decision.

I've had it refuse to merge when there is clearly plenty of room that I'd personally feel comfortable merging. Or when taking corners it get's spooked by curbs or bushes or other cars nearby. I've had it aggressively apply the brakes when cars merge in front of me, a considerable distance away. Twice I've had it think the shoulder was a turn lane for some reason. One time I had it nearly cause a rear ending by slamming on the brakes when the light turned yellow while making a left turn in an intersection.

Workers haven't done anything to deserve half the compensation their parents got for the same work. There's nothing inherent about the march of time that means young people need to work more for less. It's just greed, pure and simple. If the company could afford a pension plan for their workers in a global economy a fraction of the size it is today, then they can afford it today. They simply choose not to because they think they can get away with it. C-suites want to pocket the future retirements of thousands of people for themselves today. It's like we as a country have completely forgotten and given up on the idea that things are supposed to get better for each successive generation. It's now a race to see just how much squalor employers can put their workers in and have them still show up to work. This is highlighted at company's like Kellogg's, where people doing the same job have a pension if they were hired before around 2000, but if hired afterward have nothing, as if people in their 20s and 30s suddenly have no need for an income in their old age. Can you imagine how defeating that must feel? Showing up every day, working twice as hard as 50 year-old Barbara with your same job title, knowing the company is providing her a future and not you? We just must be built different. I sure do *wonder* why we don't want to work those jobs anymore.\n",

The issue is that management is a fucking shit show and has been for a very, very long time.  Boeing could be dissolved, picked apart by other companies who would simply resume work in their various divisions.  It's like when a bank fails, the depositors generally don't get screwed, the accounts, many of the jobs all just get handed off to the next management organization.  It's just the shareholders and leadership that get left out in the cold, and in Boeing's case I'm having trouble coming up with a leadership group that deserves that outcome more.\n",

That'll only do so much, though. The other big issue is the class 1's are sending out 2-5mi long trains that can't fit in a siding to save on labor (basically you can move 2-4 trains with a single crew), so Amtrak winds up taking the siding because their trains are usually less than a thousand feet long. Money needs to be dumped into double tracking or at least elongating sidings and installing more crossovers where double+ territory exists, and upgrading non-signaled territory to CTC (Centralized Traffic Control), but the class 1's are only interested in doing that if it'll boost their profits in the long run. Limiting train length is another possible solution, but the railroads are already hiring anyone with a pulse and clean urine when 20 years ago you had to have connections just to get an interview for a conductor job.
