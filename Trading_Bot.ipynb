If, at some point, they start producing a more mid-market vehicle, and they have some cooperation from a manufacturer who has some excess capacity... then maybe it’s not a pipe dream to see jumps in the production forecast.

And so don’t fuck around.” That was kind of the message from the German ambassador to FDR. So FDR said, “all right, that’s a good point.” So he got on a plane. He flew to Detroit. And he met Henry Ford, who was the genius titan of the world’s most innovative car company at the time. Go figure.\\n> \\n> And Henry Ford and FDR hated each other. In fact, for like 25 years prior to World War II they didn’t talk. They didn’t get along. They didn’t like each other. They had totally diametrically opposed views to government and the role of government and all this type of stuff.\\n> \\n> And they sat down at a table and they talked about World War II and what it meant to America. Two years later, Germany was still producing 10 bombers a day, right? And Henry Ford’s Willow Run plant was producing a bomber an hour. One bomber an hour.\\n> \\n> And so, like, everything about this situation for us is intimidating. And I get that. But we are capable of doing amazing things, and this facility [Brooklyn Naval Yard] is a constant reminder of that. We know for sure that alone we will fail. But together, we have the opportunity to execute the greatest technological transition in the history of humankind.

And he basically said some version of, “look, we’re Germany and we produce 10 bombers a day. And you’re the United States and you produce one bomber a day. And so don’t fuck around.” That was kind of the message from the German ambassador to FDR. So FDR said, “all right, that’s a good point.” So he got on a plane. He flew to Detroit. And he met Henry Ford, who was the genius titan of the world’s most innovative car company at the time. Go figure.\\n> \\n> And Henry Ford and FDR hated each other. In fact, for like 25 years prior to World War II they didn’t talk. They didn’t get along. They didn’t like each other. They had totally diametrically opposed views to government and the role of government and all this type of stuff.\\n> \\n> And they sat down at a table and they talked about World War II and what it meant to America. Two years later, Germany was still producing 10 bombers a day, right? And Henry Ford’s Willow Run plant was producing a bomber an hour. One bomber an hour.\\n> \\n> And so, like, everything about this situation for us is intimidating. And I get that. But we are capable of doing amazing things, and this facility [Brooklyn Naval Yard] is a constant reminder of that. We know for sure that alone we will fail. But together, we have the opportunity to execute the greatest technological transition in the history of humankind.
