With the account being new and the size you mentioned I wouldn't worry about the individual stocks you selected. Your plan to buy $30/biweekly of swppx is a really solid plan. That gets you on the right track to build wealth. The biggest thing you have right now is that you're young so you have a lot of years for that to compound. So stay the course and that ends up being a big chuck of money down the road.\\xa0\\nThe one thing I would be thinking about with your plan is to make sure you are increasing that biweekly amount when you get opportunities. If you get a raise or a promotion think about if you can take some of that and bump up your contribution. I'm 10 years into a plan that started just like you're starting. It adds up and makes a big difference.\\xa0\\nLast thing when you get up above 100k go find a financial advisor to help you out. Your current plan should get you there eventually.\\xa0\", \"Hey. So my thoughts on the portfolio is you own a lot of stuff that owns a lot of stuff. I would point out that actually your largest single stock exposure is Texas Pacific Land Corp as Knpax has a 65% allocation to that company making it account for about 8% of your total portfolio. As I looked through your funds I saw a lot of fees and a lot of relatively high fees. Generally that's not great as those fees directly reduce your returns and I think you could get the same exposure without paying 2% per year on top of a load fee. That just seems very expensive and directly counter to your goal of building wealth.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI had trouble figuring out your strategy here. You had a little bit of everything and some overlap. This is particularly true when you start to look at what each of the funds own. You sort of own a mutual fund of mutual funds. So if your targeting a specific strategy it gets lost in owning so much. For example you have VOO which is an s&p 500 index, or a large cap fund, and you have the JPM large cap fund which preforms similarly to VOO because they are both drive by the very largest names (the s&p500 is a market cap weighted average meaning the largest names are over represented). With those two specifically your getting very similar stocks in both and returns are going to be highly correlated so much so that you can basically view those as the same positions.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMy recommendation would be look at the fees your paying on those funds and see if you can move to something lower cost, look at the exposure to Texas Pacific Land Corp and decide if you are ok with 8% of your portfolio being that single stock, and then look at what is inside those funds and make sure that aligns with your strategy.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHope that helps.\", 'L', 'I have the same with Meta instead of Apple', 'Must be rich man now', 'I use DUK, COST, LLY, LMT, BRK/B for my more stable stocks.', 'How low?

Your plan to buy $30/biweekly of swppx is a really solid plan. That gets you on the right track to build wealth. The biggest thing you have right now is that you're young so you have a lot of years for that to compound. So stay the course and that ends up being a big chuck of money down the road.\\xa0\\nThe one thing I would be thinking about with your plan is to make sure you are increasing that biweekly amount when you get opportunities. If you get a raise or a promotion think about if you can take some of that and bump up your contribution. I'm 10 years into a plan that started just like you're starting. It adds up and makes a big difference.\\xa0\\nLast thing when you get up above 100k go find a financial advisor to help you out. Your current plan should get you there eventually.\\xa0\",\n",
              "   \"Hey. So my thoughts on the portfolio is you own a lot of stuff that owns a lot of stuff. I would point out that actually your largest single stock exposure is Texas Pacific Land Corp as Knpax has a 65% allocation to that company making it account for about 8% of your total portfolio. As I looked through your funds I saw a lot of fees and a lot of relatively high fees. Generally that's not great as those fees directly reduce your returns and I think you could get the same exposure without paying 2% per year on top of a load fee. That just seems very expensive and directly counter to your goal of building wealth.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI had trouble figuring out your strategy here. You had a little bit of everything and some overlap. This is particularly true when you start to look at what each of the funds own. You sort of own a mutual fund of mutual funds. So if your targeting a specific strategy it gets lost in owning so much. For example you have VOO which is an s&p 500 index, or a large cap fund, and you have the JPM large cap fund which preforms similarly to VOO because they are both drive by the very largest names (the s&p500 is a market cap weighted average meaning the largest names are over represented). With those two specifically your getting very similar stocks in both and returns are going to be highly correlated so much so that you can basically view those as the same positions.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMy recommendation would be look at the fees your paying on those funds and see if you can move to something lower cost, look at the exposure to Texas Pacific Land Corp and decide if you are ok with 8% of your portfolio being that single stock, and then look at what is inside those funds and make sure that aligns with your strategy.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHope that helps.\",\n",

lot of stuff i would point out that actually your largest single stock exposure is texas pacific land corp as knpax has a  allocation to that company making it account for about  of your total portfolio as i looked through your funds i saw a lot of fees and a lot of relatively high fees generally thats not great as those fees directly reduce your returns and i think you could get the same exposure without paying  per year on top of a load fee that just seems very expensive and directly counter to your goal of building wealth\\xa0\\n\\n\\ni had trouble figuring out your strategy here you had a little bit of everything and some overlap this is particularly true when you start to look at what each of the funds own you sort of own a mutual fund of mutual funds so if your targeting a specific strategy it gets lost in owning so much for example you have voo which is an sp  index or a large cap fund and you have the jpm large cap fund which preforms similarly to voo because they are both drive by the very largest names the sp is a market cap weighted average meaning the largest names are over represented with those two specifically your getting very similar stocks in both and returns are going to be highly correlated so much so that you can basically view those as the same positions\\xa0\\n\\n\\nmy recommendation would be look at the fees your paying on those funds and see if you can move to something lower cost look at the exposure to texas pacific land corp and decide if you are ok with  of your portfolio being that single stock and then look at what is inside those
