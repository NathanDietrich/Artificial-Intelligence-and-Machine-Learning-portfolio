Customers can also view data in custom intervals down to the tick. \n",

            "Make trades with ease: Once they’re set up and ready, it’s easy for customers to initiate trades–they can generate order forms with one click directly from a watchlist, their positions or an option chain. They can also trade directly on a chart. \n",

Since they are cash-settled and European-style, index options also have no early assignment risk and can be traded any time right up to expiration. \n",

However, as you pointed out, there are important factors that can skew this interpretation.\n",
            "\n",
            "\t1.\tGlobal Business Operations: In the 1980s, U.S. companies primarily did business within America. Today, many U.S. companies, particularly large-cap firms, earn a significant portion of their revenue from international markets. According to estimates, roughly 40-50% of revenue for companies in the S&P 500 comes from abroad. Adjusting for this, you could argue that U.S. GDP alone is no longer an appropriate denominator. One potential revision would involve adjusting the Buffett Indicator to reflect the proportion of the stock market that derives revenue domestically. This adjustment could lower the indicator by around 40%, putting it closer to 120-130%.\n",
            "\n",
            "\t2.\tInterest Rates: The Buffett Indicator also doesn’t account for historically low interest rates. When rates are low, stocks tend to be more expensive relative to GDP because the cost of borrowing is lower, and investors are willing to pay more for future cash flows. Historically, stock market valuations are higher during periods of low interest rates. If interest rates were normalized in the calculation, some analysts suggest that the indicator might need to be adjusted downward, perhaps by another 10-20%, depending on the interest rate environment you’re comparing it to.\n",
            "\n",
            "\t3.\tRevenue Composition (High-Margin Tech Companies): Today’s stock market is dominated by high-margin, tech-driven companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Google, which justify higher valuations compared to traditional industries like auto manufacturing or energy. Since tech companies tend to have higher profit margins and cash flow than older industrial sectors, investors pay a premium for these stocks. Factoring in the profitability and dominance of these sectors, this too might lower the indicator slightly, but exact estimates are harder to gauge since this is a structural market change.\n",

On top of that, demand for uranium is expected to grow as China and other nations continue to build nuclear reactors.

Basically a breeder reactor that uses a cheaper and more abundant fuel source.  This style of reactor was designed in the 1950's and I honestly believe the main reason this hasn't been developed further is more due to proliferation risks than cost or feasibility.  Since the Protactinium-233 can be extracted rather easily and would be of high concentration, it would reduce a lot of the work needed to make a nuclear weapon.

            "\n",
            "**Price Trends:** Since 2020, uranium prices have surged from $21/lb to $106/lb in February 2024, currently stabilizing at $83/lb. The report suggests that this increase is only the beginning, with further growth expected.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Uranium Overview:** Uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive metal, primarily used for nuclear energy. The key isotopes are U-238 (used in military applications) and U-235 (used to fuel nuclear reactors). U-235 is particularly efficient, with one kilogram producing energy equivalent to over 3 million pounds of coal.\n",
            "\n",
            "**HALEU and Enrichment:** High-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) is critical for advanced nuclear reactors. The U.S. is investing in domestic HALEU production to reduce reliance on imports, especially from Russia, which controls a significant portion of global enrichment capacity. The U.S. has started producing HALEU domestically, supported by government initiatives.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Supply Challenges:** Uranium supply is tightening due to depleted inventories and underinvestment in mining. Mines are expensive and slow to develop, often taking 10-15 years to become operational. The market is shifting to rely more on primary mining as secondary supplies dwindle. Primary production is forecasted to decrease by 30% by 2035, highlighting a potential supply gap.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Demand Growth:** The U.S., China, and France account for 58% of global uranium demand. As of 2024, there are 440 operating reactors worldwide, with many more planned. The World Nuclear Association predicts a 28% increase in demand from 2023-2030 and a 51% rise from 2031-2040, driven by global clean energy goals.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Global Production:** Kazakhstan is the leading producer, supplying 43% of global uranium. However, production cuts due to delays and shortages could put further pressure on prices. The U.S. has also increased its domestic uranium production in 2024, signaling a shift toward self-reliance.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Investment Insights:** The report suggests that mining companies are well-positioned to benefit from rising uranium prices. Companies like Cameco, NexGen Energy, and ETFs such as URNM and NUKZ are highlighted as investment opportunities. Big tech companies like Amazon and Google are also investing in nuclear energy, emphasizing the growing interest in this sector.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Conclusion:** The report anticipates a bullish market for uranium due to increasing demand and limited supply. With countries seeking clean energy and reducing carbon emissions, uranium's role as a key energy source is set to grow, potentially driving prices to unprecedented levels.\n",

It was calculated that ~$700/lbs is the cutoff at which point it becomes uneconomical to keep running the reactors. this is 8x the current price. due to these factors, uranium supply is price-inelastic\n",
            "Not badly. That price for uranium is in the multiple hundred dollar range ($500 to $800) compared to current $84/lb. Unlike gas and oil, the U3O8 fuel is not a major part of the overall cost to a utility running a nuclear plant. It's something like 20% of the cost. When CapEx is in the billions, you don't just not buy fuel to keep it running.\n",
